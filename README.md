# Javadoc-NG â€“ javadoc rewritten from scratch

The classic javadoc tool has been written in the 90's. Many things
have changed since then, but javadoc and the sites it generates are
still a bit old-fashioned.

Javadoc-NG is an attempt to create a modern version of javadoc, based
on modern technology and libraries as its building blocks.
It is intended to be easy to use (even without a JDK, a JRE should be
sufficient), with a command line interface but it should also be
usable as a library for build systems and other tools.

On the backend side, it uses
[JavaParser](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser),
a popular [javacc](https://github.com/javacc/javacc)-based parser,
for understanding Java source files and extracting information such as
available packages, classes, constructors, methods, fields etc. from it.
On top of that it uses an [ANTLR](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) grammar
to make sense of Javadoc comments including the
embedded HTML code and tags such as `@author`, `@param`, `@see`, etc.

Typically, a project or library that is being documented depends on a number
of third party libraries and of course the JRE libraries.
In order to create proper cross-reference links to library classes and methods,
it is necessary to build the namespace of types and members from those dependencies.
The [asm](https://gitlab.ow2.org/asm/asm) bytecode processor is used for this
task.

It builds on top of [jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/) to
generate HTML code that can be served using an embedded
[Jetty](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project) or packaged as a WAR
file for deployment on any standard application server such as Tomcat
or Glassfish.
The ability to generate static sites consisting of plain files only,
like the classic javadoc tool does, is also a goal, however preference
is currently given to an application server based deployment.

On the frontend side, it uses [Bootstrap 4](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
to create an elegant user interface. Reading software documentation on mobile
devices might be a corner case, but Bootstrap also provides us with a framework
that is well-suited for building a UI that works well on desktop screens of
varying sizes.

## Gains

* Enable search for projects that don't have that feature enabled / still
  use an old JDK's javadoc (pre Java 9)
* Enable fuzzy search using ngrams, get results even with lazy typing
* Enable source code view for projects that do not enable that in their docs
* Code highlighting in source code view
